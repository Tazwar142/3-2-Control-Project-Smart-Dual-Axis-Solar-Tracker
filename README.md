MPPT based smart solar tracker structure with LDRs(Light dependent Resistors) was built to
automatically rotate the solar panel on both horizontal and vertical axis according to position of
sun in order to capture maximum sunlight for efficient electric power conversion along with smart
cleaning mechanism for the solar panels.
